// This library provides Symbolize() function that symbolizes program
// counters to their corresponding symbol names on linux platforms.
// This library has a minimal implementation of an ELF symbol table
// reader (i.e. it doesn't depend on libelf, etc.).
//
// The algorithm used in Symbolize() is as follows.
//
//   1. Go through a list of maps in /proc/self/maps and find the map
//   containing the program counter.
//
//   2. Open the mapped file and find a regular symbol table inside.
//   Iterate over symbols in the symbol table and look for the symbol
//   containing the program counter.  If such a symbol is found,
//   obtain the symbol name, and demangle the symbol if possible.
//   If the symbol isn't found in the regular symbol table (binary is
//   stripped), try the same thing with a dynamic symbol table.
//
// Note that Symbolize() is originally implemented to be used in
// FailureSignalHandler() in base/google.cc.  Hence it doesn't use
// malloc() and other unsafe operations.  It should be both
// thread-safe and async-signal-safe.
